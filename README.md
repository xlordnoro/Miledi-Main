# Miledi-Main
This repo is **STRICTLY** for stable fixes. If you're interesting in helping me develop the bot, please do them in the **Miledi-Dev repo** and submit a pull request. While the bulk of the code is similar between the two, some modifications have been done to run on the dev discord server vs my main discord server (namely guild id's, role id's, and channel id's) and will break this repo if commits are submitted to the wrong repo.

Feel free to join my dev discord server which will contain other discord bot repos in progress as well or if you need to contact me directly @XLordnoro#2815.
